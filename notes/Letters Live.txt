16th October 1860 Hon A B Lincoln Dear Sir

My father has just home from the fair and brought home your picture and Mr. Hamlin's. I am a little girl only 11 years old, but want you should be President of the United States very much so I hope you wont think me very bold to write to such a great man as you are.

Have you any little girls about as large as I am if so give them my love and tell her to write to me if you cannot answer this letter. I have got 4 brothers and part of them will vote for you any way and if you let your whiskers grow I will try and get the rest of them to vote for you.

You would look a great deal better for your face is so thin. All the ladies like whiskers and they would tease their husbands to vote for you and then you would be President.

My father is going to vote for you and if I was a man I would vote for you. But I will try to get every one to vote for you that I can think.

That rail fence around your picture makes it look very pretty. I have got a little baby sister she is nine weeks old and is just as cunning as can be.

When you direct your letter direct to Grace Bedell Westfield County New York. I must not write any more, answer this letter right off. Good bye

Grace Bedell.

格蕾丝·贝戴尔。


SpringField Ilinois Oct 19,1860

Miss Grace Bedell My dear little Miss , Your very agreeable letter of the 15th is received.

I regret the necessity of saying I have no daughters- I have three sons- one seventeen, one nine, and one seven years of age. They, with their mother, constitute my whole family.

As to the whiskers, having never worn any, do you not think people would call it a piece of silly affectation if I were to begin it now? Your very sincere well wisher

A. Lincoln

亚伯拉罕·林肯

19th of November, 1957 Dear Monsieur Germain:

1957年11月19日亲爱的杰曼先生：

I let the commotion around me these days subside a bit before speaking to you from the bottom of my heart. I have just been given far too great an honour, one I neither sought nor solicited.

在我由衷的感谢您之前，我让我最近躁动的内心稍稍平静了一些。我刚刚被授予了一个我这一生都望尘莫及的莫大荣耀。

But when I heard the news, my first thought, after my mother, was of you. Without you, without the affectionate hand you extended to the small poor child that I was, without your teaching and example, none of all this would have happened.

而在我得知这个消息之后，除我母亲外，我第一个想到的，就是您。如果没有您，如果不是您用慈爱的手抚慰我这个可怜的小孩，如果不是您的谆谆教诲和以身作则，这一切的一切都无从谈起。

I don't make too much of this sort of honour. But at least it gives me the opportunity to tell you what you have been and still are for me, and to assure you that your efforts, your work,

我并没有荣誉等身。但至少它给了我机会让我告诉您，您对于我无论今与昔到底是怎样的存在，一样也是一个机会让您知晓，您对那些小男孩倾注的努力、您的辛勤工作、

and the generous heart you put into it still live in one of your little schoolboys who, despite the years, has never stopped being your grateful pupil. I embrace you with all my heart.

您的慷慨用心，作为您的一名学生，至今历历在目，无论时光流逝，我仍是那个感激您的学生。我全心全意地拥抱您。

Albert Camus

A blooming tree  -by Xi murong

May Buddha let us meet,
In my most beautiful hours,
I have prayed for it ,
for five hundred years,
Buddha made me a tree ,
by the pass you may take.
In full blossoms I'm waiting in the sun,
every flower carrying my previous hope.
As you are near ,listen carefully,
the quivering leaves are my waiting zeal,
as you pass by the tree , 
without noticing me,
my friend, upon the ground behind you is not the fallen petals,
but my withered heart.

July 31st, 1978 My darling McGeorge,

1978年7月31日亲爱的麦克乔治：

You said that things seemed clearer when they were written down. Well, here with a very boring letter in which I will try and put everything down so that you may read and re-read at horror at your folly in getting involved with me.

你曾说过把事情写下来，他们就会变得更清楚。那么这恐怕是一封很无聊的信，在信里我会试着把所有的东西都写下来，因此你会在恐惧中反复阅读，为爱上我而感到愚蠢。

Deep breath. To begin with I love you with a depth and passion that I have felt for no one else in this life and if it astonishes you it astonishes me as well.

深呼吸。首先，我如此深切热烈的爱你，以至于我此生不会再爱上其他人，如果这让你吃惊，它同样让我觉得不可思议。

Not, I hasten to say, because you are not worth loving. Far from it.

我必须要说，并不是你不值得去爱。远不是如此。

It's just that, first of all, I swore I would not get involved with another woman. Secondly, I have never had such a feeling before and it is almost frightening.

只是，首先我发誓我不会再爱上另外一个女人。其次，我从未有过这样的感觉，因而感到害怕。

Thirdly, I would never have thought it possible that another human being could occupy my waking (and sleeping) thoughts to the exclusion of almost everything else. Fourthly, I never thought that even if one was in love one could get so completely besotted with another person, so that a minute away from them felt like a thousand years.

第三，我从未想过会有一个人会占据我所有的时间（包括睡觉的时候）让我无时无刻不在想她。第四，我从未想过会有人，即使是处于恋爱中的人，会如此迷恋对方，以至于分开哪怕一分钟都像相隔千年。

Fifthly, I never hoped, aspired, dreamed that one could find everything one wanted in one person. I was not such an idiot as to believe this was possible.

第五，我从未希望、渴求、幻想过能在另外一个人身上得到我想要的一切。我还没有愚蠢到认为这是可能的。

Yet in you I have found everything I want: you are beautiful, gay, giving, gentle, idiotically and deliciously feminine, sexy, wonderfully intelligent and wonderfully silly as well. I want nothing else in this life than to be with you, to listen and watch you (your beautiful voice, your beauty), to argue with you, to laugh with you,

但是在你身上我找到了我想要的一切：你不但温柔美丽，还性格随和乐于助人，你性感撩人、聪明机灵中还带着点傻里傻气的天真。我这辈子只想和你在一起，聆听你的动人声音，欣赏你的美丽容颜，与你同甘共苦，

to show you things and share things with you, to explore your magnificent mind, to explore your wonderful body, to help you, protect you, serve you, and bash you on the head when I think you are wrong …

分享生活点滴，探索你的浩渺思绪和曼妙身姿，帮助你，保护你，服务你，在我认为你犯错了的时候念叨你……

Not to put too fine a point on it I consider that I am the only man outside mythology to have found the crock of gold at the rainbow's end. But – having said all that – let us consider things in detail.

坦白来说，我认为我是唯一一个在神话中的彩虹尽头发现了金匣子的人。但是说完这些，让我们从细节角度考虑。

Don't let this become public but … well, I have one or two faults. Minor ones, I hasten to say.

不要公开这件事……但是确实，我会犯一回两回错。甚至更多小错误，我必须承认。

For example, I am inclined to be overbearing. I do it for the best possible motives (all tyrants say that) but I do tend (without thinking) to tread people underfoot.

比如说，我有时候会有些蛮横。我这么做的目的是好的（所有的暴君都这么说），但是我确实容易（不加思考）忽略别人的想法。

You must tell me when I am doing it to you, my sweet, because it can be a very bad thing in a marriage. Right. Second blemish.

亲爱的，当我对你这么做的时候你一定要告诉我，因为这会是一段婚姻中非常糟糕的事情。那么，第二个缺点。

This, actually, is not so much a blemish of character as a blemish of circumstance. Darling I want you to be you in your own right and I will do everything I can to help you in this.

这其实是一个形势的瑕疵而不是一个人性格上的瑕疵。亲爱的我希望你有做自己的权利，为此我会尽我所能来帮助你。

But you must take into consideration that I am also me in my own right and that I have a headstart on you … What I am trying to say is that you must not feel offended if you are sometimes treated simply as my wife.

但同样的你也要考虑到我也有做自己的权利，而且我比你有优势……我想说的是，如果有的时候我怠慢了你，你千万不要气恼。

Always remember that what you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts. But I am an established 'creature' in the world, and so – on occasions – you will have to live in my shadow.

要时刻记住失之东隅，收之桑榆。然而我在世界上算是一个"知名"人物，有时你可能会活在我的光环之下。

Nothing gives me less pleasure than this but it is a fact of life that has to be faced. Third (and very important and nasty) blemish: jealousy.

这是让我最不开心的一件事，但是我们却都要面对。第三个缺点（非常重要和严重）：嫉妒。

I don't think you know what jealousy is (thank God) in the real sense of the word. I know that you have felt jealousy over Lincoln's wife and child, but this is what I call normal jealousy, and this – to my regret – is not what I've got.

我认为你并不知道嫉妒的真正含义（感谢上帝）。我知道你肯定羡慕过林肯的妻子和孩子，这种是我所说的一般嫉妒，但这很遗憾也是我没能得到的。

What I have got is a black monster that can pervert my good sense, my good humour and any goodness that I have in my make-up. It is really a Jekyll and Hyde situation … my Hyde is stronger than my good sense and defeats me, hard though I try.

我得到的是一个能够扭曲我的想法、幽默和善良的邪恶怪物。这是一个双重人格的情况……我的邪恶面要比我的善良面更强，并且打败了我，尽管我尽力反抗也于事无补。

As I told you, I have always known that this lurks within me, but I could control it, and my monster slumbered and nothing happened to awake it. Then I met you and I felt my monster stir and become half awake when you told me of Lincoln and others you have known,

正如我告诉你的一样，我一直知道这些潜伏在我心中，我能控制它，我内心的怪物正蛰伏，却没有任何事物能够唤醒它。之后我遇见了你，我心中的怪物苏醒了，并且在你告诉我林肯以及其他你认识的人的时候就已经半醒了，

You will never know how terribly corrosive jealousy is; it is a physical pain as though you had swallowed acid or red hot coals. It is the most terrible of feelings.

你不会知道恶毒的嫉妒会有多么糟糕，那像是喝下迷幻药或者是烧红煤块带来的痛。这是最糟糕的感觉。


But you can't help it – at least I can't, and God knows I've tried. I don't want any ex-boyfriends sitting in church when I marry you.

但是你却无能为力——至少我不行，上帝知道我尝试过了。当我迎娶你的时候，我可不想有任何一位男朋友坐在教堂里面。

On our wedding day I want nothing but happiness, both for you and me, and I know I won't be happy if there is a church full of your ex-conquests. When I marry you I will have no past, only a future: I don't want to drag my past into our future and I don't want you to do it, either.

在我们结婚的那天，我只希望你我都幸福，但是我知道，如果教堂里都是你的前任，我是不会高兴的。当我娶你的时候，我们就忘掉过去，只看到未来：我不想我的过去介入我们的未来，我同样不希望你的过去介入。

Remember I am jealous of you because I love you. You are never jealous of something you don't care about.

记住，我嫉妒你，是因为我爱你。你不会嫉妒任何你不关心的事。

O. K. enough about jealousy. Now let me tell you something.

好了，关于嫉妒就到这里。现在我要告诉你一些事情。


I have seen a thousand sunsets and sunrises, on land where it floods forest and mountains with honey coloured light, at sea where it rises and sets like a blood orange in a multicoloured nest of cloud, slipping in and out of the vast ocean.

我看过无数次日出日落，在大地上，森林和群山都被笼罩在光芒之中，在大海上，为五彩的云朵增添上一抹血橘色，在无垠的大海上划进划出。

I have seen a thousand moons: harvest moons like gold coins, winter moons as white as ice chips, new moons like baby swans' feathers. I have seen seas as smooth as if painted, coloured like shot silk or blue as a kingfisher or transparent as glass or black and crumpled with foam, moving ponderously and murderously.

我看过无数次月亮：满月如金币，寒月洁白似冰屑，新月宛如小天鹅的羽毛。我看过大海平静如止，颜色如缎，或蓝如翠鸟，或如玻璃般透明，抑或如乌黑褶皱的泡沫，沉重而危险的翻动着。

I have felt winds straight from the South Pole, bleak and wailing like a lost child; winds as tender and warm as a lover's breath; winds that carried the astringent smell of salt and the death of seaweeds; winds that carried the moist rich smell of a forest floor, the smell of a million flowers.

我感受过来自南极的烈风，寒冷呼啸着像一个走失的儿童；感受过如爱人呼吸般的柔风；掺杂着苦涩的咸味和海草死亡气息的海风；弥散着森林大地肥沃土壤气息和千万种花香的山风。

Fierce winds that churned and moved the sea like yeast, or winds that made the waters lap at the shore like a kitten. I have known silence: the cold, earthy silence at the bottom of a newly dug well; the implacable stony silence of a deep cave;

狂风涛海如同酵母发酵起沫，或使海水轻拍海岸像小猫一般。我了解宁静：一口新井中寒冷又朴实的宁静；一个深洞中无情冷酷的宁静；

the hot, drugged midday silence when everything is hypnotised and stilled into silence by the eye of the sun; the silence when great music ends. I have heard summer cicadas cry so that the sound seems stitched into your bones.

炎热迷离的午后万物被炎炎烈日催眠的宁静；一曲美妙音乐结束的宁静。我听过夏日蝉鸣如芒在骨。

I have heard tree frogs in an orchestration as complicated as Bach singing in a forest lit by a million emerald fireflies. I have heard the Keas calling over grey glaciers that groaned to themselves like old people as they inched their way to the sea.

我听过树蛙在无数萤火虫点亮的森林中演奏着如巴赫管弦乐般美妙复杂的旋律。我听过啄羊鹦鹉飞跃冰川叫喊着，像老人呻吟着走向大海。

I have heard the hoarse street vendor cries of the mating Fur seals as they sang to their sleek golden wives, the crisp staccato admonishment of the Rattlesnake, the cobweb squeak of the Bat and the belling roar of the Red deer knee-deep in purple heather.

我听过声嘶力竭的街道商贩成交皮草生意的叫嚷，好像是对他们鎏金妻子的赞美；响尾蛇清脆却不连贯的警告声；成群结队的蝙蝠的刺耳叫声；马鹿在齐膝的紫石楠中的咆哮。

I have heard Wolves baying at a winter's moon, Red howlers making the forest vibrate with their roaring cries. I have heard the squeak, purr and grunt of a hundred multi-coloured reef fishes.

我听过狼群在冬夜对月长嚎，红吼候啸震山林。我听过珊瑚群中异彩斑斓的鱼群发出的吱吱、呱呱和呢喃。

I have seen hummingbirds flashing like opals round a tree of scarlet blooms, humming like a top. I have seen flying fish, skittering like quicksilver across the blue waves, drawing silver lines on the surface with their tails.

我见过蜂鸟如同宝石一般围绕着开红花的树闪烁，如陀螺一般哼鸣作响。我见过飞鱼如水银一般穿越蓝色海浪，用他们的尾翼在海面上划下银色痕迹。

I have seen Spoonbills flying home to roost like a scarlet banner across the sky. I have seen Whales, black as tar, cushioned on a cornflower blue sea, creating a Versailles of fountain with their breath.

我见过琵鹭像朱红的旗帜从鸟巢飞往鸟群。我见过漆黑洳焦的鲸鱼，在如矢车菊般的蓝色海洋中停留，呼吸间创造了一个凡尔赛宫的喷泉。

I have watched butterflies emerge and sit, trembling, while the sun irons their wings smooth. I have watched Tigers, like flames, mating in the long grass.

我见过阳光熨展蝴蝶的翅膀，它浮现、停顿、又扇动。我见过鲜如火焰的老虎在长草之中亲昵。

I have been dive-bombed by an angry Raven, black and glossy as the Devil's hoof. I have lain in water warm as milk, soft as silk, while around me played a host of Dolphins.

我曾被愤怒的乌鸦俯冲攻击，如魔鬼的爪牙黑暗顺滑。我曾躺在温暖如牛奶、柔顺如丝绸的水中，任一群海豚在我身边嬉戏。

I have met a thousand animals and seen a thousand wonderful things … All this I did without you.

我曾遇到过无数生灵，曾看过无数美景……这一切却未与你共度。

This was my loss. All this I want to do with you.

这都会是我的损失。这些事情我都想与你共度。

This will be my gain. All this I would gladly have forgone for the sake of one minute of your company, for your laugh, your voice, your eyes, hair, lips, body,

这一切才会是我的收获。为了有你一分钟的陪伴，我愿放弃这一切，为你的笑声，你的声音，你的眼睛，头发，嘴唇，身体，

and above all for your sweet, ever surprising mind which is an enchanting quarry in which it is my privilege to delve.

尤其是你善良又令人惊喜的心，那时只有我有权利开采的宝藏。

November 5,2006. Dear Xavier High School, and Ms. Lockwood, and Messrs Perin, McFeely, Batten, Maurer and Congiusta:

2006年11月5日。亲爱的泽维尔中学，洛克伍德女士，还有佩林、麦克菲利、巴腾、莫勒、孔朱斯塔诸位：

I thank you for your friendly letters. You sure know how to cheer up a really old geezer (84) in his sunset years. I don't make public appearances any more because I now resemble nothing so much as an iguana.

很感谢你们的来信。你们一定很懂怎么去让一位迟暮之年（84岁）的老人获得莫大的鼓舞。我不再出席公众活动，因为我知道我现在老的像一只鬣蜥。

What I had to say to you, moreover, would not take long, to wit: Practice any art, music, singing, dancing, acting, drawing, painting, sculpture, poetry, fiction, essays, reportage, no matter how well or badly, not to get money and fame, but to experience becoming, to find out what's inside you, to make your soul grow.

然而我要告诉你们的话并不太长，即：进行任何艺术活动吧，音乐、唱歌、舞蹈、绘画、油彩、雕塑、诗歌、小说、散文、报告文学，不论做的好与坏，也不是收获名利，而是为了利用这些经历发现你内心真正的样子，为了让你的灵魂成长。

Seriously! I mean starting right now, do art and do it for the rest of your lives. Draw a funny or nice picture of Ms. Lockwood, and give it to her.

我是认真的！我是说现在就开始，从事艺术活动，并且在你的一生中坚持下去。画一张滑稽的或者美丽的洛克伍德女士像，然后送给她。

Dance home after school, and sing in the shower and on and on. Make a face in your mashed potatoes.

放学之后跳着舞回家，洗澡的时候放声歌唱，诸如此类的事情。在你的土豆泥里画个鬼脸。

Pretend you're Count Dracula. Here's an assignment for tonight, and I hope Ms. Lockwood will flunk you if you don't do it: Write a six line poem, about anything, but rhymed.

假装你是德古拉爵士。你们今天晚上有个任务，如果你们不做的话，我希望洛克伍德女士会给你们个不及格：写一首六行的诗，关于什么都行，但一定要押韵。

No fair tennis without a net. Make it as good as you possibly can. But don't tell anybody what you're doing.

韵脚就像网球的网，没有它可谈不上作诗。尽你所能的让这首诗好一些。但是别告诉任何人你在做什么。

Don't show it or recite it to anybody, not even your girlfriend or parents or whatever, or Ms. Lockwood. OK? Tear it up into teeny-weeny pieces, and discard them into widely separated trash receptacles.

别给其他人看，也别背给别人听，即便是你的女朋友、你的父母、其他什么人、或者是洛克伍德女士。好吗？撕成碎纸片，然后扔到远远的垃圾桶里。

You will find that you have already been gloriously rewarded for your poem. You have experienced becoming, learned a lot more about what's inside you, and you have made your soul grow.

你会发现你已经为你的诗找到了最好的回报。你已经体会了这种经历，已经对你的灵魂了解了更多，也使它得到了成长。

God bless you all! Kurt Vonnegut

上帝保佑你们所有人！柯尔特.冯内古特


### 6 #################################################################

没想到你竟如此的小
简直是一条软体的虫子
当我伸出偌大的双手
却不知如何抱你
 
你第一次见我，
就面似老人，就满脸皱纹，
你究竟走了多长的时间多少的路
才从生命的源头
跌进我的手中
 
你冷不丁发出一个声音
把自己轻轻吓了一跳
 
你原本想笑来着
没有笑好，却哭了
 
全乱套了
吃饭和睡觉
白天和黑夜
生活得重新安排
现在几点了
 
满月了
给你剃个光头
留下第一缕头发
用一根红线系好
放进你的相册
等哪一天你也老了
还能看看它
 
 
你走姥姥家去了
你妈妈抱着你走姥姥家去了
你可真狠心
你一走就走了
一二三四五六天
我跟你说吧
我是忍着才没有去看你
并且告诉自己
每天只想你一次
你知道吗，我的孩子
不管你哪一天回来
那一天就是我的节日
 
就跟谈恋爱时一样
我又开始说些可笑的话
比如说大高楼很高
比如说大苹果很大
上一回是你妈妈笑了
这一回是我笑了
你只是瞪着两只大眼
仿佛看我
 
你叽里咕噜的言语
都是生命的密码吧
你对我说了那么多
我一听，傻了
 
我三十岁了，你三个月了
我抱着你，你也抱着我
身后那个偷偷爬上来的孩子
是叫个月亮吧
我仿佛也是第一次看见它
 
  
把整齐的都弄乱了
把站着的都打翻了
把干净的都玩脏了
你便快乐地笑了
 
你病了，等于是天塌了
我们都成了没主意的人
我们对医生微笑
我们对护士微笑
我们不停地点头
恨自己和他们攀不上亲戚
 
跌倒了
你趴在地上不起来
左瞧右瞧，你看见了我
于是，你哭了
 
跌倒了
你趴在地上不起来
左瞧右瞧，你没有看见我
于是，你自己爬起来
 
突然间有个想法
想自己一夜间变老
这样就能看见
你长大后的样子了
  
你不是我的希望，不是的
你是你自己的希望
我那些没能实现的梦想还是我的
与你无关，就让它们与你无关吧
你何妨做一个全新的梦
那梦里，不必有我
我是一件正在老去的事物
却仍不准备献给你我的一生
这是我的固执
然而我爱你，我的孩子
我爱你，仅此而已
 
你不是我的财富，不是的
如果你一定是财富
那你是时间的财富，是未来的财富
你如此宝贵，我怎能占为己有
一直以来，我都不愿意承认
其实在生命的意义上我们都是奇迹
就像未来不会比现在更重要
你我也只能是对方人生的某个部分
然而我爱你，我的孩子
我爱你，仅此而已
 
你甚至不是我的孩子，我是说
当神明通过我将一口生气传递给你
我想我愿我又怎能做你一生的保护神
总有一天，我将成为一种无用的东西
我看着你看着你，却无能为力
然而我爱你，我的孩子
我爱你，仅此而已
 
我爱你，仅此而已
然而我爱你多些
就像我父亲爱我多些
事情只能如此
